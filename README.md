Final Practical Project for QA

o	Why are we doing this? 
  We are doing this project as a final project of a 9 week Software developer bootcamp. The aim is to build a simple API Springboot using Java from what we have learnt           throughout our time with QA.
  
o	How I expected the challenge to go.
  I expected the challenge to be difficuilt to complete.
  
o	What went well? / What didn't go as planned?
With a bit of a refresher session I found using Git and Jira straightforward. We learnt Jira and Git in the first week of the bootacamp. Adding additional tables and DTOS in the project was part of the plan, however to finish the project in time with I did not carry it out. I have used one table to represent books in a library. This database was created on H2.
